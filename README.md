Its still on beta, stay tuned!

# Assistbot

> This is the NEXT GENERATION of assistbot

This features robust features of assistbot

- Be able to generate image/text from pollination.ai
- Supports enum
- Clean & more understandable module arrangement

It's already tested in [Shuttle](https://shuttle.dev), but since I used the free plan, I can't show the demo atm

# Installation
Go to the root folder and run the build command
```shell
$ cargo build
```

To publish to [Shuttle](https://shuttle.dev), or if you want to run it normally, you need to install `cargo-shuttle` since it was hardcoded with that crate

```shell
$ cargo install cargo-shuttle

# use it like this
$ cargo shuttle run
```
